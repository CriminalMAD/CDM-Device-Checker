Easily parse the cdm device info response from: https://tools.axinom.com/decoders/LicenseRequest  

SITE STATUS: `ACTIVE`

## **TIPS**:
## Add context menu for easy check from challange.txt or client_id_blob

INSTRUCTIONS:

- Just double click the **`add_context_menu.bat`** to automatically add context menu into your registry
- You can also change the context title ("Check Client Id Blob") inside the bat file

## **CHANGELOGS**

## [1.0.7] | 2022-01-28

- Automatically run "add_context_menu.bat" as admin
- Don't write challenge.txt automatically
- Print client id blob basic info if --quite mode enabled
- Prompt to load challenge from "challenge.txt" if input is empty
- Colored is now optional (see config.py)
    - NOTE: For windows 7, if you want to print colored text, you can use **[ansicon](https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon/releases)**.
    - INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Extract the zip file
        - Take the folder (x86 if you are using 32bit / x64 if 64bit) and place somewhere and then add the binary to your **Environment Variables**
        - Simply run for the first time in your cmd: **`ansicon -i`**
        - Now it should be injected to your cmd and colored text should show normally.
